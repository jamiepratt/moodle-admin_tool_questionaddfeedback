Moodle Admin Tool Plug In for Adding Feedback to Questions
----------------------------------------------------------

You can batch add correct / partially correct / incorrect feedback to questions in a selected context or category.

This admin tool was written by Jamie Pratt (http://jamiep.org/).

It is compatible with Moodle 2.2+ (the admin tool plug in type was introduced in 2.2)

### Installation

#### Using git 

To install using git for a 2.2+ Moodle installation, type this command in the
root of your Moodle install:

git clone git://github.com/jamiepratt/moodle-admin_tool_questionaddfeedback.git admin/tool/questionaddfeedback

Then add admin/tool/questionaddfeedback to your git ignore.

#### Not using git 

Alternatively, download the the file archive from

* zip - https://github.com/jamiepratt/moodle-admin_tool_questionaddfeedback/zipball/master
* tar.gz - https://github.com/jamiepratt/moodle-admin_tool_questionaddfeedback/tarball/master

Uncompress it into the admin/tool folder, and then rename the new folder to questionaddfeedback.
